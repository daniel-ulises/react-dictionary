# React Dictionary

This is a simple dictionary App that uses the [OwlBot](https://owlbot.info) API to retrieve the definitions and examples. I decided to use SASS again and continue practicing with it.

This is an early version of the App and I plan on updating it a little bit, there are a few things I would like to add, such as information on a word that is not found, which is currently not implemented yet.

# Live Demo

You can see it live [here](https://daniel-ulises.github.io/react-dictionary).
